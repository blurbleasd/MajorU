        <h2><u>About this Book</u></h2>
        <p>Not every story is worth telling. Here's one anyway.</p>
        <p>Skip Lewers spent his life convinced he was meant for something greater. Now, in his final words, he retraces a career that never quite was, the loves that never quite worked out, and a world that won’t miss him when he’s gone.</p>
        <p>Darkly funny, deeply human, and quietly devastating, <i>Gonna Roll Myself Up to the Top of the Hill</i> is a memoir/suicide note of rare precision and unsparing wit—the first installment in the final account of a man who spent decades believing he was destined for <i>something</i>.</p>
        <p>If history is truly written by the winners, this book would not exist.</p>
